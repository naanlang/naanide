/*
 * nide_sworker.js
 * Naanlib/frameworks/browser
 *
 *     Nide service worker script.
 *
 * The goal of this service worker is to 1) cache fetch requests for static content, and 2) relay
 * fetch requests in the /run/ URL path namespace to instances of the IDE that can provide it. The
 * identifier for the various browser windows is by "clientId", which is a GUID reported by the
 * service worker and message channel APIs. Here we use the term clientId to refer to windows that
 * consume data in the /run/ path, i.e. the IDE targets, and the term sourceId to refer to windows
 * that provide data, i.e. the IDE instances.
 *     When the service worker is first executed it sends messages to all known windows requesting
 * that they establish a message channel and forward the service worker's port to it. This secondary
 * channel is used to communicate fetch requests from the service worker to the source IDE and then
 * get the response. If an IDE is executed subsequently then it registers itself by sending the port
 * unilatterally, instead of waiting to be requested.
 *     The service worker gets a fetch request when a non-cached resource is requested by a client
 * window. If the URL path is not within /run/ then this executes a normal network request. IF the
 * URL path is within /run/ then this asks the IDE source(s) to fetch it. Initially every IDE source
 * is sent the request, but when one provides a 200 response then this stores that source port under
 * the clientId in fetchPorts so that subsequent requests can go only to the correct IDE. This works
 * great until an IDE goes away or becomes unresponsive.
 *     Unfortunately there is no event that tells us when a window is closed or goes away. The first
 * indication of trouble is when an IDE fails to respond within a reasonable amount of time, which
 * could be anything. We can enumerates the valid clients, which gives us a chance to validate our
 * knowledge of which ones are responding. If a request takes longer than a second to respond then
 * this executes a validate operation, which eliminates any clients that have gone away and rejects
 * their pending operations.
 *     One potential problem is stale caches. When an older version is discovered then we notify the
 * client and invalidate the old cache.
