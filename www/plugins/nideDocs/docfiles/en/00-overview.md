Onramp
======

Welcome to Onramp, the place to become acquainted with the Ask How project, which is built on the Naanâ„¢ software platform.

Here you will find a series of folders, each containing tutorials and explanations for different aspects of the system. Please ask questions and report problems you find in the #onramp channel of the Ask How Dev slack workspace.

Folder **1.0 Command Line** begins with the installation and use of the Naan command line tool, which is OSS available on NPM. Using Naan starts with evaluating expressions, creating the canonical Hello World program, using the inbuilt command line debugger, and an introduction to more advanced topics.

Folder **2.0 NaanIDE** introduces the browser-based Naan IDE.

Subsequent folders are planned.
